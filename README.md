# Spring Hibernate Examples
This repository contains example projects for the different Enterprise Java EE Spring based applications to help myself and novice developers to understand how a spring/Hibernate based applications is wired up to produce a full fledged application. I will add a seperate Wiki later to lay out all the steps that I have followed to debug and build some of my main applications

We have separate folders for the samples of individual applications
##SpringDemo
Followed the demo from SpringBoot and ouath2. Very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login through facebook api via Spring Boot’s @EnableOAuth2Sso (if you visit the home page you will be automatically redirected to Facebook)
Used Java 8,Spring Boot, social login to facebook using Oauth


##ScialClick
Adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login. Followed this tutorial from Spring guide. https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/
