# Spring Hibernate Examples
This repository contains example projects for the different Enterprise Java EE Spring based applications to help myself and novice developers to understand how a spring/Hibernate based applications is wired up to produce a full fledged application. I will add a seperate Wiki later to lay out all the steps that I have followed to debug and build some of my main applications
<h5>SpringDemo</h5> : followed the demo from SpringBoot and ouath2. Very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login through facebook api via Spring Bootâ€™s @EnableOAuth2Sso (if you visit the home page you will be automatically redirected to Facebook).</br>
<h5>ScialClick</h5> : adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.</br>
<h5>ecommercestore</h5> : This is primarily a reference/tutorial website which shows how a spring/Hibernate/MongoDB/AngularJS/Bootstrap is wired to built a moden enterprise web application</br>
