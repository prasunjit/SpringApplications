<h3>Contains sample Spring applications for different purposes </h3></br>
SpringDemo : followed the demo from SpringBoot and ouath2. Very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login through facebook api via Spring Boot’s @EnableOAuth2Sso (if you visit the home page you will be automatically redirected to Facebook).</br>
ScialClick : adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.
